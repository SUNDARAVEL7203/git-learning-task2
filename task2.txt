rite a blog on difference between Document and Window Objects in Javascript

WINDOW
The window object represents the browser window or frame that contains a web page. It is the global object in a browser environment, 
means all global variables and functions are properties of the window object.

Key Features
1.Global Scope : All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.

2.Methods and Properties:
Location: window.location provides information about the current URL and allows you to redirect the browser to a new URL.
History: window.history provides methods to navigate through the browser history (e.g., back(), forward())

3.Events:
The window object can listen for events such as load, resize, and scroll.

The Document Object
Definition
The document object represents the HTML document loaded in the browser window. It is a property of the window object and provides
 methods and properties to access and manipulate the content of the web page.

Key Features
1.DOM Manipulation:
The document object is essential for interacting with the DOM (Document Object Model), which represents the structure of an HTML 
document.Methods like getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(), querySelector(), and querySelectorAll() are used to select and 
manipulate HTML elements.

2.Properties:
document.title: Gets or sets the title of the document.
document.body: Represents the <body> element of the document.
document.head: Represents the <head> element of the document

                      KEY DIFFERENCES
1. Scope and Purpose:
The window object is the global object that represents the browser window itself and provides methods and properties to control the 
browser and its environment.The document object represents the HTML document loaded in that window and provides methods and properties
to interact with the content and structure of the web page.

2.Global Variables:
Variables and functions declared globally become properties of the window object, not the document object.

3.Event Handling:
While both objects can handle events, they cater to different kinds of events. The window object handles events related to the browser.

4.DOM Manupulation.
The document object is specifically designed for DOM manipulation, allowing you to traverse, create, and modify HTML elements
